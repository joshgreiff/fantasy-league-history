## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"League ID not configured"**
- Make sure `LEAGUE_ID` is set in `.env.local`

**"Failed to fetch league data"**
- Check your ESPN cookies are current and valid
- Private leagues require both `ESPN_S2` and `SWID`
- Public leagues may work with just the `LEAGUE_ID`

**"No data available"**
- Ensure your league has completed games
- Check that the season parameter matches your league

**Cookies expired**
- ESPN cookies expire periodically
- Re-login to ESPN and get fresh cookie values

1. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify your `.env.local` configuration
3. Test with a public league first (no cookies required)
4. Make sure you're using the correct season year
